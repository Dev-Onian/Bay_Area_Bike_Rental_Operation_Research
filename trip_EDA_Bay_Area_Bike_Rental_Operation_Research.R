# Trip EDA

# 1. Look at the data, get a sense of what it is like

# 2. Perform an EDA on a copy of the data
# a) Install tidyverse, funModeling, and Hmisc


# b) Examine data, make sure there is enough for suitable analysis, make sure everything is the right form


# c) Clean a copy of the data, including removing outliers - note what was changed


# d) Analyze categorical variables: do the categories make sense? Missingness?


# e) Analyze numerical variables: outliers? What is the distribution of data? What are the standard deviations?


# f) Analyze categorical and numerical variables at the same time: get a sense of all the variables to be analyzed
