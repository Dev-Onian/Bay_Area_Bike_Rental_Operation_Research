# Weather EDA

# 1. Look at the data, get a sense of what it is like

# 2. Perform an EDA on a copy of the data
# a) Install tidyverse, funModeling, and Hmisc
library(tidyverse)
library(funModeling)
library(Hmisc)

# b) Examine data, make sure there is enough for suitable analysis, make sure everything is the right form

RawWeather <- read.csv("weather.csv")
summary(RawWeather)
sum(as.character(RawWeather$max_temperature_f) == "")
sum(as.character(RawWeather$mean_temperature_f) == "")
sum(as.character(RawWeather$min_temperature_f) == "")
sum(as.character(RawWeather$cloud_cover) == "")
# date is character instead of POSIX
# No missing values in the temperature variables, either as NAs or empty cells
# Need to examine visibility's units of miles, since there are visibility readings in excess of 4 miles, whereas human visibility on the ground is limited by the curvature of the Earth to only 3 miles. Note, this might be referring to laser visibility rather than geodesic visibility 
# precipitation_inches includes trace values, will set it to be 0.001 inches, which is lower than 0.01 inches

# c) Clean a copy of the data, including removing outliers - note what was changed
CleanedWeather <- RawWeather


# d) Analyze categorical variables: do the categories make sense? Missingness?


# e) Analyze numerical variables: outliers? What is the distribution of data? What are the standard deviations?


# f) Analyze categorical and numerical variables at the same time: get a sense of all the variables to be analyzed
