# Weather EDA

# 1. Look at the data, get a sense of what it is like

# 2. Perform an EDA on a copy of the data
# a) Install tidyverse, funModeling, and Hmisc
library(tidyverse)
library(funModeling)
library(Hmisc)
library(dplyr)


# b) Examine data, make sure there is enough for suitable analysis, make sure everything is the right form

RawWeather <- read.csv("weather.csv")
summary(RawWeather)
sum(as.character(RawWeather$max_temperature_f) == "")
sum(as.character(RawWeather$mean_temperature_f) == "")
sum(as.character(RawWeather$min_temperature_f) == "")
sum(as.character(RawWeather$cloud_cover) == "")
# date is character instead of POSIX
# No missing values in the temperature variables, either as NAs or empty cells
# Need to examine visibility's units of miles, since there are visibility readings in excess of 4 miles, whereas human visibility on the ground is limited by the curvature of the Earth to only 3 miles. Note, this might be referring to laser visibility rather than geodesic visibility 
# precipitation_inches includes trace values, will set it to be 0.001 inches, which is lower than 0.01 inches

# c) Clean a copy of the data, including removing outliers - note what was changed
CleanedWeather <- RawWeather
CleanedWeather$date <- strptime(CleanedWeather$date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
# SK I prefer you use <- instead of =
CleanedWeather$precipitation_inches[CleanedWeather$precipitation_inches=="T"]=0.001
CleanedWeather$precipitation_inches <- as.numeric(CleanedWeather$precipitation_inches)
CleanedWeather$events[CleanedWeather$events==""]="Not Recorded"
CleanedWeather$events[CleanedWeather$events=="rain"]="Rain"
CleanedWeather$events <- factor(CleanedWeather$events)
CleanedWeather$city <- factor(CleanedWeather$city)


# d) Analyze categorical variables: do the categories make sense? Missingness?
summary(CleanedWeather$events)
# high degree of missingness: 1473 Not Recorded - may indicate no weather events (sunny days are not coded for)
# Ways to impute missingness:
# - Fog: visibility less than 1 km
# - Mist: visibility between 1 km (0.62 mi) and 2 km (1.2 mi)
# - Haze from 2 km (1.2 mi) to 5 km (3.1 mi)
# - Temperatures at 14 F (-10Â°C) is too cold for the air to contain super-cooled 
#   water droplets so for forms small tiny ice crystals.
# - Rain: any amount of precipitation, even trace
# - Thunderstorm: hot temperatures, cloud cover, wind-speed, but highly variable
# SK Good research ^ here. Good idea to keep imputed events in a separate column.

# All of the measurements are within the bounds of planet Earth, for example, the maximum wind speeds are far below the fastest wind speed recorded on Earth (408 km/h)

# f) Analyze categorical and numerical variables at the same time: get a sense of all the variables to be analyzed
